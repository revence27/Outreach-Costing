Questions Regarding Project Development
=======================================

1.  Why are quarters so inconsistent? Like childrenâ€™s deworming, which is empty save for the first quarter.

2.  Why are there constants in the columns, unaffected by the population?

3.  When to produce?

4.  Could Health Sub-Districts span more than one district?

5.  Requirement: HSDs per district require name, pop, congregation.

6.  Number of venues already exists for some.

    * How does it relate to HSDs and so on?

7.  The population that matters: district? HSD? Congregations?
